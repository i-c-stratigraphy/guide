## Chapter 1. Introduction

### A. Origin and Purposes of the Guide
The purposes and spirit of this short version are the same as those of the second edition of the Guide: to promote international agreement on principles of stratigraphic classification and to develop an internationally acceptable stratigraphic terminology and rules of stratigraphic procedure-all in the interest of improved accuracy and precision in international communication, coordination, and understanding.

### B. Composition of Subcommission
The membership of the Subcommission represents a worldwide geographic spread of stratigraphers and stratigraphic organizations and a wide spectrum of stratigraphic interests, traditions and philosophies.

Over the years, the number of members has ranged from 75 to 130 representing 30 to 45 countries.

### C. Preparation and Revision of the Guide

### D. Spirit of the Guide
Like the second edition of the International Stratigraphic Guide, this abridged version is offered as a recommended approach to stratigraphic classification, terminology, and procedure, not as a &quot;code&quot;.

### E. National and Regional Stratigraphic Codes
The ISSC has always supported the development of national and regional stratigraphic codes; these codes have helped in the past in developing principles, and providing a testing ground for various proposals contained in the Guide.

### F. Alternative or Dissenting Views
